+ Refactored the way ACO runs are started. GP system avoids multiple problem data readings.

2010/02/26
+ Implement a calling function for the GP system that avoids loading the TSP instance on every evaluation.

2010/02/24
+ separation of code into several files and basic clean up done.
+ Output to files done. Parsers for output files needed.

2010/02/19
+ MMAS with HCF is implemented but needs more validation. 
  Does not give good results as it is
+ Refactoring should be done soon.

2010/02/18
+ MMAS is working. However, still requires refinements (e.g., better update ant rule).
+ Ant algorithms must include an HCF version, especially MMAS.
+ Output statistics of algorithm runs is a priority

2010/02/10
+ MMAS is incomplete. Requires the mechanism for restart and convergence analysis.
+ check the computation of the branching factor (MMAS essential)
+ refactor code to allow better multiple ant architectures
