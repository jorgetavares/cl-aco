# cl-aco
Common Lisp library for Ant Colony Optimization based algorithms. It contains Ant System, Elite Ant System, Rank Ant System and Min-Max Ant System. Other variats can also be built. The aim was to have a Lisp library that would have some of the main ACO variants. It contains then specific code for TSP, QAP and MKP. The code was not optimized for speed. 

The current code is no longer in active development.
